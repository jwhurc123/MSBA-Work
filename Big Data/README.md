These are all of my homework files for my Big Data Modeling and analytics Class. These files require Apache Spark and Pyspark installed in order to run. All of these homework files are configured to use Spark Submit, so you have to download the input file included, and use Spark Submit or change the input path for the files to run. The only exceptions is the "mapPartitions()HW.txt" file, which is just practice and has an input hard-coded in the file.
