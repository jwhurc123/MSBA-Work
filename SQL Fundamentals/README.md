These are all of my assignments and some lecture practice to showcase my SQL knowledge. Included are .sql files and .db files
where available, and there are .doc and .pdf files that contain questions answered with screenshots of the corresponding .sql
file.

*** Must need some way to interpret and edit SQL code for the .sql and .db files. ***
